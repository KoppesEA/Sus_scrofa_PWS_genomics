Retinas were removed, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Cat#FC-122-1001) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.
RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols

    <Data-Processing>
Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

    <Data-Processing>
Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

Retinas were removed, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Cat#FC-122-1001) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.
RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols

    <Data-Processing>
Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

    <Data-Processing>
Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

Retinas were removed, flash frozen on dry ice, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Cat#FC-122-1001) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries.
RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols

    <Data-Processing>
Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

Smart-Seq2 method was used to amplify the single cell sample. The reaction system for the first cDNA strand synthesis comprised the reverse transcription enzyme, buffer, TSO primers and oligo-dT primers with common sequence. For the second strand synthesis, added PCR amplification reagent and ISPCR primer with common sequence to the first strand products. The sample cDNA was fragmented into 300bp by Bioruptor®Sonication System (Diagenode Inc.), and then performed terminal repair, addition of A, and ligation of sequencing adapters, and amplified. The PCR amplification product with 350-450bp was extracted. Then, the concentration was measured by Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). The integrity of the amplified products was detected by Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.

    <Summary>
The inner cell mass in blastocyst is the origin of all the somatic and germ cells in mammals, and of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. As the conserved principles between pig and human, here we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq for porcine early embryos from oocyte to early blastocyst. We show the specification of inner cell mass and trophectoderm in morula, and the molecular signature of the precursors. We demonstrate the existence of naïve pluripotency signature in morula and inner cell mass of early blastocyst, and the specific pluripotent genes and the activity of signalling pathways highlight the characteristics of the naïve pluripotency. We observe absence of dosage compensation with respect to X-chromosome in morula, and incomplete dosage compensation in early blastocyst. However, the dynamics of dosage compensation may be independent on the expression of XIST induced X-chromosome inactivation. Our study describes molecular landmarks of embryogenesis in pig that will provide a better strategy for derivation of porcine pluripotent stem cells and improve the research in regenerative medicine.
