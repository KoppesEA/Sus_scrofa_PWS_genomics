Performing VEP annotation
Possible precedence issue with control flow operator at /ihome/crc/install/vep/python3.7_vep95/lib/site_perl/5.26.2/Bio/DB/IndexedBase.pm line 845.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

The VEP can read gene data from either a local cache or local/remote databases.

Using a cache is the fastest and most efficient way to use the VEP. The
included INSTALL.pl script can be used to fetch and set up cache files from the
Ensembl FTP server. Simply run "perl INSTALL.pl" and follow the instructions, or
see the documentation pages listed below.

If you have already set up a cache, use "--cache" or "--offline" to use it.

It is possible to use the public databases hosted at ensembldb.ensembl.org, but
this is slower than using the cache and concurrent and/or long running VEP jobs
can put strain on the Ensembl servers, limiting availability to other users.

To enable using databases, add the flag "--database".
